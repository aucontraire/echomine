# Specification Quality Checklist: Echomine AI Chat Parser

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

### Quality Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories with independent test criteria
- Comprehensive functional requirements organized by concern area
- Well-defined edge cases with explicit handling requirements
- Technology-agnostic success criteria with measurable metrics
- Detailed assumptions document implementation defaults
- Clear scope boundaries with explicit out-of-scope items

**No Issues Found**: All checklist items pass validation.

## Notes

The specification successfully balances completeness with clarity. All requirements are testable, user stories are independently deliverable, and success criteria provide clear validation targets. Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`.
